<p>Hi there! Thanks for visiting my blog!</p>
<p>I’m Arafath Hossain. I am a data scientist by profession, and a curious soul by nature. Currently I’m working for a public university in a small beautiful twin city called Bloomington-Normal in Illinois, US.</p>
<p>My primary areas of interest in Data Science are predictive modeling, and causal inferences. I love to make the bridge between data science and the business users through building data science focused applications! Before moving into Data Science, I worked in market research and product management. My business background helps me to see a problem from the business users’ point of view and then use my technical capabilities to tie in their business need with the solution.</p>
<p>While not working or spending my time dabbling into new and exciting areas of Data Science, I enjoy traveling, catching fish, watching movies, and watching documentaries on random topics! Also, I spend a lot of time in LinkedIn connecting and interacting with people. So if you are in LinkedIn feel free to connect with me <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arafath-hossain/">here</a> or if you are an emailing kind of person drop me an email at <a href="mailto:a.h.fahad90@gmail.com" class="email">a.h.fahad90@gmail.com</a>!</p>
