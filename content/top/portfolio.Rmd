### Using K Nearest Neighbor to Understand Hollywood Movies

ðŸŽ«R ðŸŽ«Web App ðŸŽ«ML ðŸŽ«Data Viz

A Shiny app that has been built as an R package using `golem` framework. The primary goal of this application is to help users:

1)  Interactively explore the data, and
2)  Use an algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to cluster the observations for a deeper understanding of both the data and model.

### Text Analysis on Youtube Videos

ðŸŽ«R ðŸŽ«NLP

This analysis was part of an ongoing exploratory study about how Bangladesh was presented through contents shared on different internet platforms. In a previous [article](https://curious-joe.net/post/twitter-topic-modeling-sentiment-analysis/) tweets that contained 'Bangladesh', a South Asian country, were analyzed to understand the most common areas that people tweeted about Bangladesh and what kind of sentiments were reflected. In this article, a similar analysis was conducted on the videos shared on Youtube that had Bangladesh in their titles.
