<a href="https://curiousjoe.shinyapps.io/HollywoodMovies2/" class="button">Live App</a> <a href="https://github.com/Curious-Joe/HollywoodApp2.0" class="button">GitHub Repo</a>

A Shiny app built as an R package using `golem` framework. The primary goal of this application is to help users:

1)  Interactively explore the data, and
2)  Use an algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to cluster the observations for a deeper understanding of both the data and model.

This analysis was part of an ongoing exploratory study about how Bangladesh, a south Asian country, was presented through contents shared on different internet platforms. In a previous [article](https://curious-joe.net/post/twitter-topic-modeling-sentiment-analysis/) tweets that contained 'Bangladesh' were analyzed to understand the most common areas that people tweeted about Bangladesh and what kind of sentiments were reflected. In this article, a similar analysis was conducted on the videos shared on Youtube that had Bangladesh in their titles.
