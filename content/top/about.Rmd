I am a data scientist by profession. Currently I'm working in the higher education industry. Before moving into the area of Data Science, I worked in market research and product management. 

I like the constant improving nature of the technologies used in data science and Machine Learning areas and love to experiment with new tools and methodologies. 

While not working, I enjoy travelling, catching fish, watching movies, learning about new technology and watching documentaries on random topics! 

And also I love connecting and interacting with people in LinkedIn! So please feel free to connect with me via LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/arafath-hossain/) or drop me an email at (a.h.fahad90@gmail.com).
