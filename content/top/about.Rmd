I am a data scientist by profession. I work in the higher education industry. I come from a business management background with trainings in computer programming. I have worked in the market research and telecommunication industries before moving into data science.

I love the always changing and improving nature of the technology industry especially in the area of data science and artificial intelligence. 

I have a bachelor degree in Business Administration and MS in Quality Management and Assurance. Currently I am working as a data scientist at Illinois State University, Illinois first public university!

While not working, I enjoy travelling, catching fish, watching movies, learning about new technology and watching documentaries.
